# For Fun, I Homelab

Welcome! This blog is a place to share my homelab adventures — tinkering with server racks, running open-source software, and experimenting with large language models.

For fun, I [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/). That means:

- Rack-mounted servers in the basement
- Self-hosted tools like Proxmox, pfSense, and Nextcloud
- Breaking stuff (and sometimes fixing it)
- Running LLMs on local hardware — just because I can

## What You'll Find Here

- Project setups
- Lessons learned (often the hard way)
- Tips for home IT nerds
- Occasional AI experiments

If that sounds like your kind of fun, stick around.
