## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

Welcome! This is where I share my homelab adventures â€” tinkering with server racks, running open-source software, and experimenting with large language models.

For fun, I [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/). That means:

- Rack-mounted servers in the basement
- Self-hosted tools like Proxmox, OPNSense, and Kubernetes
- Breaking stuff (and sometimes fixing it)
- Running LLMs on local hardware â€” just because I can

If that sounds like your kind of fun, stick around.

â€” *Your Friendly Homelabber*
